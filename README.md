# Evax-mini-project

In this project we are using Angular for the frontend + mock APIs


## Architecture 
MVVM:  Model, View, ViewModel <br/>
We choose this architecture because it makes the application evolution easier and improves its maintenance by separating the user interface from the application logic. 


## Why Angular ? 

Angular is one of the most popular frameworks that follows this architecture.

Every component has a: 
- View: HTML file
- View Model : the TS file 
- Model : Ts class
