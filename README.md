## Architecture 
MVVM:  Model, View, ViewModel <br/>
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern helps to maintain a clean separation between application logic and the UI, help to address numerous development issues and can make an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve.

### Why we choose it ? 
We choose this architecture because it makes the application evolution easier and improves its maintenance by separating the user interface from the application logic, which is exactly our need in our case in order to have a robust appication.


## Why Angular ? 

Angular is one of the most popular frameworks that follows this architecture.

Every component has a: 
- View: HTML file
- View Model : the TS file 
- Model : Ts class
