## Project Structure : 

We took advantages from the Angular structure to make 3 different folders 

- View folder: HTML files that represent the UI of our APP 
- ViewModel folder: TS files that represent the view logic 
  - +Service folder for any logic with the database 
- Model folder: TS classes that define our entities 


## What we use in This project : 

- Communication between view and view model 
  - Event Binding 
  - Property binding 

- Dependency injection of the services 

### NOTES

the files ``data.json`` and ``user.json`` contain the data returned by our mock APIs
